# Parkinsonism Frozen Gait Change Point Detection based on Fréchet Statistics

This is a paper discussing the detection of multiple change points between freezing of gait (FoG) and normal gait in Parkinson's disease. It includes a dataset folder containing raw and stitched human skeletal data of AlphaPose and Kinect3D types. The algorithm section comprises data preprocessing and change point detection using Fréchet & LAD. It also includes generated images and results.
